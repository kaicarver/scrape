# scrape

web scraping experiments

It's time for me to update my web scraping skills.

I'll put aside `curl`, `wget`, and my dusty old Perl scripts
and try something new.

## scrapy and 750words.com

I'll start with scrapy, and with a simple task:
I want to retrieve my daily writing from 750words.com.
The difficulty is I need to login to get my stuff.

But let's be patient and start with the tutorial.
