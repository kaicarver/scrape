# scrape

web scraping experiments

It's time for me to update my web scraping skills.

I'll put aside `curl`, `wget`, and my dusty old Perl scripts
and try something new.

## scrapy and 750words.com

I'll start with scrapy, and with a simple task:
I want to retrieve my daily writing from 750words.com.
The difficulty is I need to login to get my stuff.

But let's be patient and start with the tutorial.

<https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html>

This looks like a good explanation of how to login:

Well it's nice except the code example has about 10 bugs...
